# Kaggle-Dont-Overfit
predicting the binary variable labelled ”target” (note - no information is provided about this variable). We want you to build a predictive model for this binary outcome without overfitting to the minimal data provided.

There is a small sample size to build your model on (“Dataset_1.csv”) and a large number of cases to predict the “target” on (“Dataset_2.csv”). Please note all cases are in rows and variables in columns in each of the datasets. Only dataset_1 has class labels for the “target” variable (supervised), dataset_2 has no class labels (unsupervised), we have hidden the “target” labels for the purposes of this exercise in dataset_2.
